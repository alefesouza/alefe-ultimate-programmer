# Alefe Ultimate Programmer

> My canGoBack always return false. That's my programmer way!

**Version:** Alpha 0.1

**Project Creation Date:** 19/05/2016

**What I knew about games development:** Nothing

There's more than three years that this ideia appeared on my mind but I always thought that game development was hard, but after I went to a meetup using Unity and it's more easier than a thought, and I also can use my favorite programming language, C#.

The ideia of this game is to be a "cover" of Naruto Ultimate Ninja (I like Naruto series and games very much), something like a fight game version of [SuperTuxKart](https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code) inspired on Naruto, but instead of ninjas, it'll have people important to the programming history and some friends of mine, for example:

Naruto Uzumaki = Alefe Souza

Madara Uchiha = Bill Gates

Hashirama Senju = Steve Jobs

Kaguya Ootsutsuki = Ada Lovelace

I always thought to create it in 3D like the Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm game series, but I don't have time to study design/3D modelation (I prefer to study programming hahaha) so it's 2D trying to make pixel arts, so there will be the Alefe Ultimate Programmer first (in 2D like Naruto Ultimate Ninja), and after the Alefe Ultimate Programmer Assembly (in 3D like Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm game series).

All the game version will be free and open-source, because "I like to spread knowledge" hahaha, I like to think that someone will learn how to make games or apps analyzing my code, in the same way I learned to code analyzing other people code.
